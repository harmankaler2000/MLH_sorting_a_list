# MLH_sorting_a_list
A python program to sort a list for MLH Day 5 submission

Day 5 project submission for MLH

This project is a submission for the DAY 5 for Major League Hacking - MLH Local Hack Day: Build.

I have used the built in sort function to sort a list of numbers taken as an input from the user.
